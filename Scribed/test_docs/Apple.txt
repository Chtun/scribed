it finally happened Apple succumb to the hype and will bring us one step closer to the AI dystopia that we've all been hoping for in the near future your iPhone won't just be smart it'll be intelligent and I'm not talking about artificial intelligence but Apple intelligence yesterday Apple changed the world by bringing AI to everyone and by that of course they mean everyone with an iPhone 15 Pro or better it's able to do amazing things like analyze all your photos and email to prompt chat GPT help you cheat on your homework and send creepy generated photos to your friends on their birthday and so much more because we're talking about Apple this new feature is already receiving a delusional level of Praise from the mainstream but it does have some haters like Elon Musk who made an empty threat to ban intelligent Apple products from his companies and in today's video I'll explain the unpopular opinion of why Apple intelligence is actually kind of dumb it is June 11th 2024 and you're watching the code report yesterday Apple gave the keynote for its worldwide developer conference but the reality is that WWDC is not for developers it's for shareholders Apple Inc used to be the most valuable company in the world world but was surpassed by Microsoft and Nvidia just a few days ago that's unbelievably humiliating and for the last year everybody's been asking when is Apple going to do something with AI well yesterday Apple made a genius move they rebranded the acronym AI from artificial intelligence to Apple intelligence an idea at stole from Alibaba surely A3 trillion company has the resources to train its own large language model well apparently not basically Apple intelligence is able to understand the context of everything that's going on on your device like your emails photos and so on this experience is built into Apps throughout the system then perform useful actions like set reminders in your calendar based on what's going on in your life now Apple does have its own AI models that run on device and it will attempt to use those as a first Resort but if those models are too dumb to get the job done it'll then prompt GPT 4 remotely you'll be able to access chat GPT for free and that sounds pretty similar to those creepy co-pilot plus PCS that everyone was freaking out about last week to be fair Apple does have a much better reputation when it comes to privacy but how could they possibly share your data with open AI remotely and still call that private well they introduced a new thing called private Cloud compute that allows your phone to offload complex jobs to the cloud Apple claims it will never store your data your requests and information will not be logged and this private Cloud will be audited by Third parties to ensure your private data is not leaking somewhere it shouldn't be however the reality is that your data is being processed by some Clos Source software on a server connected to the internet that's not yours Apple has always stated that it will never let the government use the back door but for anyone who really cares about privacy this is likely not acceptable what's even more crazy though is Apple's partnership with open AI their Tech now has its tentacles inside both Microsoft and Apple products and apple intelligence is a big win for Microsoft because they're entitled to 49% of open ai's Future profits it's a really interesting thruple situation that we've got going here and apple might even let Google get in on the action too by offering Gemini is an alternative to GPT 4 ultimately though normal people don't care about privacy and they just want a useful iPhone the new features in Siri will allow you to get a lot more done by just talking to your phone and it makes these new devices like the rabbit R1 even more dead than it was on arrival but Apple intelligence also killed a bunch of other startups like it'll also be able to rewrite text and fix grammar thus making grammarly obsolete but the coolest app was this handdrawn AI calculator which will make virtually every other calculator app obsolete in addition your iPhone will also be able to generate crappy AI pictures and you can even create your own custom emojis but really the biggest thing that died yesterday was anything that was a CH GPT wrapper because now your iPhone is basically just a chat GPT wrapper that's pretty awesome but if you're just a poor loser with an iPhone 15 standard or Worse you're not going to get apple intelligence we all know that Apple's MO is fomo but it takes a lot of computing power to run AI models the A6 ship on the iPhone 15 only has 6 GB of RAM and the npu can do 17 tops while the A7 pro has 8 GB of RAM and can handle 35 tops that's a pretty big difference but we're only looking at the Baseline here we are just getting started Apple just built a foundation to grift us with AI fomo for the next 10 years but if things keep going at this rate it's only a matter of time before the iPhone becomes more intelligent than you are at which point it can truly optimize your happiness by recommending you buy a flip phone and switch to Linux this has been the code report thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one
